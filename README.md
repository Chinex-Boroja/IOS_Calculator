IOS_STANDARD_CALCULATOR

This is a simple Apple IOS inspired calculator, essesntially designed and developed for basic arithmetic operations. This application was designed with SceneBuilder for major part of the user interface, incorporated in JavaFX which is a framework in JAVA. The codes were primarily written in JAVA.

GETTING STARTED

These instructions will enable you run the application on your local machine;

PREREQUISITES

At least Java SDK 11 (JDK 11-JDK 13 will require the Open JavaFX 11 SDK) installed in your computer system.
JavaFX SDK 11 installed in your computer system in the same directory with the JDK. 
An Integrated Development Environment (Preferably Intellij IDEA used to developed the program).

TESTING

This project includes a runnable jar file name IOS_Calculator.jar that can be used to quickly run the current state of the application. The location of this jar file is in out/artifacts/IOS_Calculator_jar/IOS_Calculator.jar Which can be run directly on the Intelli J IDEA. This jar file can be run through the command prompt opened in that(out/artifacts/IOS_Calculator_jar/IOS_Calculator.jar) location by typing this "java --module-path "Javafx path location(in your local machine)" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar IOS_Calculator.jar CalculatorMain" without the quotes. In addition, there is a windows batch file name Calculator.bat that you can double click to run the app instantly located in the out/artifacts/FootballApplication_jar/RunApp.bat folder used in windows operating system.

If you would like to modify the source files, the project structure is as follows...

The src directory contains all the java package(s) mentioned below.

The source(src) package contains the necessary java files such as; EventControls.java, Calculator.java, and calculator.fxml file for designing the user interface.

CONTRIBUTING

I am the only one currently working on this project for the timw being.

PLEASE NOTE: 
This application cannot take above two numbers and perform the calculation at a go. I will still add more functionality to take more than two numbers at a go.
It also has the limitation of trailing Zero.
There is also a limited amount of floating point numbers it can accommodate on the screen. I will still add more functionality to that to curtail it.
